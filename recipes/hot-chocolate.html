<p>With full-size chocolate bars leftover from Halloween, I wanted to use some up and decided to try to make hot chocolate out of one. The result was fabulous!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 (1.55 ounce) bar milk chocolate, chopped</li>
  <li>â…” cup milk, or more to taste</li>
  <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place chocolate pieces in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add milk and whisk constantly until chocolate is melted and well blended, about 5 minutes. Whisk in cinnamon. Remove from heat; add more milk if desired. Serve in a mug.</li>
